Modular

Modular is a C++ project designed to streamline the process of downloading and managing mods for various games. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that can fetch mod information from different sources (e.g., NexusMods, GameBanana), organizes downloaded files, and offers features like directory merging and renaming.
Features

    Multiple Mod Repositories
    Currently supports sources like NexusMods and GameBanana.

    Directory Merging
    Automatically merges directory structures of mods into a common folder.

    Renaming Support
    Includes functionality to rename mods or files based on metadata fetched from APIs.

    Cross-Platform Build
    Uses CMake to build on Linux and soon to cross compile for Windows.

Dependencies

    C++17 or later
    CURL
    Used for making HTTP requests to fetch mod data from APIs.
    nlohmann/json
    A header-only JSON library for parsing and handling JSON responses.

Building

These instructions assume a Linux environment with a working C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++) and CMake installed.

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Modular.git
cd Modular

Configure the Project with CMake:

cmake .

    CMake will detect required dependencies and prepare build files.

Build the Project:

    make

        This produces the executable(s) inside the bin directory (or directly in the project root depending on your CMake configuration).

Cross-Compiling for Windows

If you’re on Linux and want to build a Windows executable:

    Make sure you have MinGW-w64 installed (e.g., x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++).
    Edit CMakeLists.txt to enable cross-compiling.
    Run:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/your/toolchain-file.cmake .
    make

    The resulting Windows executable will be placed in the bin folder (or the specified build directory).

Usage

    Run the Executable
    From inside the repository (or wherever the Modular binary is built):

./bin/Modular_Linux

Or, if you are on Windows:

    Modular_Windows.exe

    Menu Interface
        The application will present a simple menu where you can select different actions:
            Download Mods from NexusMods or GameBanana
            Merge Directories
            Rename mods/files based on metadata
            Exit the application

    Fetching and Merging Mods
        Provide the game domain and mod IDs when prompted to retrieve names via the NexusMods or GameBanana APIs.
        The program will store and merge mod directories into a unified structure to simplify mod management.
